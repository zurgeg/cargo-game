# Cargo
A simple game for your (or a ML model's) enjoyment 

## How to play
Your "truck" (represented by an "@") is your character, you must get the truck to a source (H, I or J) to pick up cargo.

Once you have cargo, a "Cargo" section will be displayed below fuel. This shows you where you need to bring that cargo.

For instance, if it says `["A", "B", "C", 1]` you must bring it to A, then B, then C, then 1. Once you get cargo to the end, you score a point.
